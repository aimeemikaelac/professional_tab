I am a Security Engineer employed by Facebook on the Corporate Security team. I am also a graduated Ph.D. student at the 
[University of Colorado Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu/) in the [Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering]
(http://ecee.colorado.edu/). I worked with Professor Eric Keller in the Network and Security Research Group (NSR). I received my 
undergraduate degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the [Colorado School of Mines](http://www.mines.edu/). My
research interests are in embedded and network security, but I am also interested in networking, embedded systems, distributed systems
and operating systems, including mobile applications and software-defined networking.
